# [Simple Markdown](https://wbrawner.com/portfolio/simple-markdown/)

Simple Markdown is simply a Markdown editor :) I wrote it to offer up an open source alternative to
the other Markdown editors available on the Play Store. I also wanted to get some practice in
creating Android apps and have a little something to put into my portfolio.

## Roadmap

* Auto-save
* Night mode
* Save to cloud (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive)
* Disable live preview in landscape mode
* Disable preview tab for better performance in large files
* Custom CSS for Markdown preview
* Auto-scroll preview to match edit view in landscape mode

## Contributing

I'd love any contributions, particularly in improving the existing code. Please just fork the
repository, make your changes, squash your commits, and submit a pull request :)
